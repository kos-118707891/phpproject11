        <h2><strong>About Autonomous Things</strong></h2>
            <body>
            <p>The emergence of autonomous things over the last few years, I believe, has been an exciting development within technology that is only going to become more innovative and more and more exciting as time goes on. Driven by the likes of big data, AI and cloud technologies, I have no doubt that – as these technologies advance – autonomous things are only going to continue to advance at a break neck speed.</p>
