<body><h1><u> My Favourite Sport- Swimming</u>
</h1>
<p> Swimming is my favourite sport. I enjoy it a lot. Swimming is a sport which almost everyone enjoys on a hot summer day, yet not many people know much about the details of competitive swimming. I shall give some information about the sport so as to help people understand the sport better. I have also inserted some useful links in this article for those seeking more information on the different strokes.

  <p><h3><u>
     Main Strokes  
  </u></h3></p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Freestyle</b>- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming"> Freestyle </a>is the fastest of all the four main strokes. A beginner typically is introduced to swimming through freestyle.<img class=pic1 src="http://www.active.com/Assets/Swimming/460x345/perfect-freestyle-460.jpg" width="200"/>  In freestyle, the swimmer lies flat on his stomach in the water. He does the flutter kick with his legs and moves his arms in a rotating motion simulataneously.  </li>

    <br></br>
    <li><b>Breaststroke</b>-This is considered by most people as the slowest stroke. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaststroke"> breaststroke</a>, the swimmer does a frog like kick with his legs.<img class=pic1 src="http://www.teambath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/PA-14178963.jpg" width=200/> Despite being slow, this is the most energy conservative stroke and is used during all open swimming events. </li>

    <li><b>Backstroke</b>- This is the most unique stroke of all as the swimmer swims while he lies on his back. <img class=pic1 src="https://instabeat-avatars-production.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/22143845/Backstroke.jpg" width=200/> The technique used in<a href="http://www.enjoy-swimming.com/backstroke.html"> backstroke</a> is similar to freestyle, except it is done on the back. I enjoy this stroke the most.</li><br></br>

    <li><b>Butterfly</b>- This is the most impressive stroke of all.In<a href="http://www.enjoy-swimming.com/butterfly-stroke.html"> butterfly</a> the legs make a dolphin like wave motion which propels the body forward at a very fast speed. <img class=pic1 src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/03/article-2183061-144C6750000005DC-424_964x525.jpg" width =200/> The arms make a circular motion while pulling out. This is universally recognised as the most tiring stroke as it forces the muscles of the core to work very hard.</li>

</ol>
<li><b>Individual Medley</b>- In a medley , the swimmer swims all four strokes one after the other. The stroke is changed at a regular interval of 25m,50m or 100m.
